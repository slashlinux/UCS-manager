I had a customer ask me for a way to easily collect all serial number from a UCS so they could give to their services team to make sure everything was covered under their SmartNet contract.  This is what I came up with.
 
This script allows you to log into a single or multiple UCS Domains and it will create an Excel spreadsheet of all the devices and their serial numbers.
 
Prerequisites:
  PowerShell v3 or greater enabled on your client machine
  Network access to your UCSM
  An account on your UCSM
  Excel installed on the client machine
  Cisco PowerTool for PowerShell installed in the client machine
 
Change Log:
     v0.5 - Initial posted version
     v0.5.01 - Added feature to exit script if you only provide a single domain and domain log in fails or if you are not logged into any UCSM.
     v0.5.02 - Added one more error check for login
     v0.5.03 - Found that older B230's that don't have DIMMs in a slot report their serial number as NO DIMM.  Look for that and ignore entering those into the inventory.
     v0.5.04 - Requires PowerShell V3 and now has a check to ensure you are running it or higher.
     v0.6 - Added a column with the associated Service Profile for the equipment where applicable.
     v0.7 - Added a column with the manufacturing date/time of the equipment where available.
     v0.8 - Added section to collect local hard disk info
     v0.9 - Added built in help.  Command line options.  Standard naming convention.
     v0.9.0.1 - Added support for saved credentials file
     v0.9.10 - Add fields with UCSM Licensing Information
 
As always, let me know if you have any questions, problems or suggestions.

.SYNOPSIS
	Collect all serial numbers in UCS domain(s) and write them to a formatted Excel spreadsheet

.DESCRIPTION
	This script will log into a single or multiple UCS domains and collect all serial numbers and output the collected information to a formatted Excel Spreadsheet
	This script can take a LONG time to run due to the amount of data collected and the speed of writing information to Excel.  Please be patient!

.EXAMPLE
	Get-UcsSerialNumbers.ps1
	This script can be run without any command line parameters.  User will be prompted for all parameters and options required

.EXAMPLE
	Get-UcsSerialNumbers.ps1 -ucs "1.2.3.4" -ucred
	-ucs -- UCS Manager IP or Host Name -- Example: "1.2.3.4" or "myucs" or "myucs.domain.local" or "1.2.3.4,5.6.7.8" or "myucs1,myucs2" or "myucs1.domain.local,myucs2.domain.local"
	-ucred -- UCS Manager Credential Switch -- Adding this switch will immediately prompt you for your UCSM username and password
	All parameters are optional and any skipped will be prompted for during execution
	The only prompts that will always be presented to the user will be for User Names and Passwords
	
.EXAMPLE
	Get-UcsSerialNumbers.ps1 -ucs "1.2.3.4" -saved "myucscred.csv" -skiperrors
	-ucs -- UCS Manager IP or Host Name -- Example: "1.2.3.4" or "myucs" or "myucs.domain.local" or "1.2.3.4,5.6.7.8" or "myucs1,myucs2" or "myucs1.domain.local,myucs2.domain.local"
	-savedcred -- UCSM credentials file -- Example: -savedcred "myucscred.csv"
		To create a credentials file: $credential = Get-Credential ; $credential | select username,@{Name="EncryptedPassword";Expression={ConvertFrom-SecureString $_.password}} |Export-CSV -NoTypeInformation .\myucscred.csv
		Make sure the password file is located in the same folder as the script
	-skiperrors -- Tells the script to skip any prompts for errors and continues with 'y'
	All parameters are optional and any skipped will be prompted for during execution
	The only prompts that will always be presented to the user will be for User Names and Passwords
